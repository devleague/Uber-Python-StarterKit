# Uber Python StarterKit

Uber Hackathon Starter Kit for Python

The sample code makes calls to the [sandbox api](https://developer.uber.com/v1/sandbox/) endpoints at https://sandbox-api.uber.com/v1/

The sandbox url should be used for development.

The production api url is https://api.uber.com/v1/

## Requirements

- have an uber account
- create an app at https://developer.uber.com
  - set `http://localhost:8080/oauth/cb` as Redirect URL (go to App Dashboard > Authorizations)
- have python installed (tested with python 3.5.0 and 2.7.10)
- have pip installed
- use pip to install the [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/) module
    - `pip install requests`
- clone this project, all commands are issued from inside this project directory

### Environment Variables

You should never commit your secret/private information to your scm.

Each script requires environment variables to be set in a file named `.env`

copy `.env-sample` to `.env` and follow the template to add your uber api keys

example

```
UBER_SERVER_TOKEN="YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE"
UBER_CLIENT_ID="YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE"
UBER_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE"
```

this information can be found from your uber developer console by editing an app that you have created. https://developer.uber.com/dashboard

scripts will be run by reading the `.env` file. the env variables are set during when running a script per _session_, that is, the environment variables will not persist.

this is done by running `env $(cat .env | xargs) ...your command`

if you do not have the `xargs` program (it is installed in osx and ubuntu linux by default), then you can install it for your operating system.

or, set each environment variable manually without `.env`

example

```
UBER_SERVER_TOKEN=your-uber-server-token \
UBER_CLIENT_ID=your-uber-client-id \
UBER_CLIENT_SECRET=your-cient-secret \
...your command
```

## Problems?

if you are seeing errors, make sure that there is a `.env` file located in the current directory which should be the project root, and that it is in the same format as `.env-sample` and that it has valid secret keys and tokens from the uber developer api.

## Simple requests

The Uber API has 3 routes that only require server side authentication, and do not require a user to authorize via OAuth2

```
GET /v1/products
GET /v1/estimates/time
GET /v1/estimates/price
```

### Products

https://developer.uber.com/v1/endpoints/#product-types

run the `simple_products.py` script

`env $(cat .env | xargs) python simple_products.py`

## OAuth2 Requests

*Requirements*

- use pip to install the [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/) module
    - `pip install requests`
- use pip to install the [`rauth`](http://rauth.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) module
    - `pip install rauth`
- use pip to install the [`Flask`](http://flask.pocoo.org/) micro framework
    - `pip install Flask`
- run the `oauth2_server.py` script to run a server listening on port `8080`
    - `env $(cat .env | xargs) python oauth2_server.py`


### Authorizing, step 1

The first step in the OAuth2 authorization process is to get the uber login url.

visit the oauth2_server app in your browser, go to http://localhost:8080/oauth/login

**OR**

run the `oauth2_get_login_url.py` script

`env $(cat .env | xargs) python oauth2_get_login_url.py`

result

```
https://login.uber.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Foauth%2Fcb&client_id=mEBB-pbUk_LhdXp9YQ_dRzWxShvzRZDe&scope=profile
```

### Authorizing, step 2

you will be prompted to login if you are not already logged in to uber.

then you will be prompted to accept the `scopes` requested from `oauth2_get_login_url.py line:16` or `oauth2_server.py line:22`

after accepting, and authorizing your account with the app using uber, you will be redirected to your callback url which should be accessible from your local server listening on port `8080`

example redirect url
```
http://localhost:8080/oauth/cb?code=nmOqxLryF6QmAe6VzfbVgMfnZRifhp
```

on successful authorization, you should see your access token in the browser

example `access_token`

```
rgHxpYJABmBmiiG0DBOXvgoKyVY10v
```

copy this, you will need it for step 3


**Problems?**

if you get an error like this:

```
ERROR

THE BASE REDIRECT URI DOES NOT MATCH THE REQUESTED REDIRECT
```

then make sure that your app settings has a `Redirect URL` to your application that matches the url in `oauth2_get_login_url.py line:15` or `oauth2_server.py line:23`


### Authorized, step 3

Using the `access_token`, you can now make authorized calls to the rest of the uber api endpoints.

getting the user profile:

visit the oauth2_server /profile route with your browser at http://localhost:8080/profile?access_token=[your access_token from step 2]

example

```
http://localhost:8080/profile?access_token=rgHxpYJABmBmiiG0DBOXvgoKyVY10v
```

## Running Examples in Docker

Docker is a great way to run this demo in a predictable isolated environment.

Change your current working directory to the root of this project that you have cloned.

_the --rm flag will create an ephemeral container that will destroy itself when you exit_

**Starting a container with python 2.7.10**

```
docker run --rm --name uber-python-starterkit -v "$PWD":/app -w /app -it -p 8080:8080 python:2.7.10 bash
```

**Starting a container with python 3.5.0**

```
docker run --rm --name uber-python-starterkit -v "$PWD":/app -w /app -it -p 8080:8080 python:3.5.0 bash
```

**Once you are in a running container**

install the required dependencies

```
pip install rauth requests Flask
```

then you can run any of the above commands
